<h1>Nourish Is <em>For Impact Organizations</em></strong>
<p>What if your organization was funded by
  people who benefit from and believe in it;
  instead of venture capital, loans, grants
  or big donors? What if you could <strong>
  <em>fund your impact</em> with the support
  of <em>members who are invested and engaged
  </em>in your purpose?</strong></p>
<p>

<p>Nourish provides organizations with the
  tools to <strong>attract and onboard
  members</strong>, engage them, and
  <strong><em>make a sustainable impact.</em>

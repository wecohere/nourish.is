Nourish.is a community membership funding platform for cooperatives, non-profits, and other community organizations.

It uses [Dwolla](https://www.dwolla.com) for ACH transactions, and can be hosted for free on [Glitch](https://glitch.com)

At some point, it will begin to need to store data, in which case our goal is to use AirTable for persistence; or offer the ability to pay for managed hosting.
